Sheer Volume and Fragmentation\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSAP systems contain millions of objects (e.g. 27 million standard objects in S/4HANA alone). These are scattered across:\\n\\n- Transaction codes, function modules, BAPIs\\n- Tables, views, and CDS views\\n- Business objects and APIs\\n- Configuration settings and enhancement points\\n\\nThere\'s no single, searchable index that shows \\"here\'s what SAP can do out of the box.\\"\\n\\n## 2. Poor Native Search and Documentation\\n\\n- **SE37/SE80 are limited**: You need to know _what_ you\'re looking for. If you don\'t know a function module exists, you can\'t search for it effectively\\n- **SAP Help Portal is generic**: Documentation describes features conceptually but doesn\'t surface specific technical objects\\n- **No semantic search**: Traditional keyword searches miss relevant objects if you don\'t use exact SAP terminology\\n\\n## 3. Knowledge Gap Between Business Requirements and Technical Objects\\n\\nWhen a business user says \\"we need to auto-calculate freight costs,\\" consultants must translate that to:\\n\\n- Is there a standard BAPI for this?\\n- Does pricing configuration handle it?\\n- Are there relevant BAdIs or user exits?\\n- What tables store freight data?\\n\\nThis translation requires deep system knowledge that junior/mid-level consultants often lack.\\n\\n## 4. Time Pressure and Misaligned Incentives\\n\\n- **Research is unbudgeted risk**: No time is set aside purely for research. Even if a consultant diligently searches for standards for a day and finds nothing, they\'re a day behind on implementation with nothing to show for it\\n- **Visible effort bias**: It\'s harder to prove the effort and complexity of your work when you propose a standard solution. Writing 10,000 lines of custom code is immediately recognizable; finding the right BAPI is not\\n- **Default to custom**: Many consultants default to \\"build custom\\" because it\'s faster than proving a standard solution exists (or doesn\'t) and custom code is easier to justify on timesheets\\n\\n## 5. Version Complexity\\n\\nECC 6.0 vs S/4HANA have different capabilities. A consultant might not know:\\n\\n- CDS views in S/4HANA could replace their custom join logic\\n- A new RAP business object exists for their use case\\n- An old BAPI has been deprecated/replaced\\n\\n## Why SAP Research Agent Matters\\n\\nSAP Research Agent solves the **discoverability problem**. By indexing ~50M standard objects and making them semantically searchable, it essentially asks consultants: \\"Did you check if SAP already built this?\\" before they write code.\\n\\n:::info\\nTry out SAP Research Agent here: https://research.getadri.ai/\\n:::"},{"id":"/research-agent/reddit-launch","metadata":{"permalink":"/adri-docs/blog/research-agent/reddit-launch","editUrl":"https://getadriai.github.io/adri-docs/tree/main/blog/research-agent/reddit-launch.md","source":"@site/blog/research-agent/reddit-launch.md","title":"Reddit Launch","description":"We launched on Reddit and it crashed our app. \ud83e\udee0","date":"2025-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Research Agent","permalink":"/adri-docs/blog/tags/research-agent","description":"research-agent tag description"}],"readingTime":1.11,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Darshita Chaturvedi","title":"Co-Founder & CEO, Adri AI","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/darshitac/","page":{"permalink":"/adri-docs/blog/authors/dc"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/darshitac/","github":"https://github.com/darshitac11"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/darshitac11.png","key":"dc"}],"frontMatter":{"tags":["research-agent"],"authors":["dc"],"date":"2025-11-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why Finding Standard SAP Objects Is Difficult?","permalink":"/adri-docs/blog/research-agent/why-it-matters"},"nextItem":{"title":"How does Claude\'s newest model perform in SAP ABAP development?","permalink":"/adri-docs/blog/genai/claude-opus"}},"content":"We launched on Reddit and it crashed our app. \ud83e\udee0\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI had assumed Reddit wasn\'t where our audience was.
